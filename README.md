# PashtoLigatureBase
This Data-set contains 1000 unique Pashto ligatures with 4 different scale and rotation variations.
Each file is referred with a name like: P3_342_1085.bmp
Where P3, refers scale variations and can hold P1 to P4 values (i,e,. for 4 scale variations; font size 12=P1, font size 14=P2, font size 16=P3, and font size 18=P4.
Smilarly _342_ (in the P3_342_1085.bmp) is the ligature ID, which is unique for each scale and its rotation variations.
